# Changelog

## master

 - #1428
   - Implement `mask()` for `FieldValue<u16>` which seems to have been 
     skipped at some point.
   - Implement `read()` for `FieldValue` so that individual fields
     can be extracted from a register `FieldValue` representation.
 - #1461: Update `register_structs` macro to support flexible visibility of each
   struct and each field. Also revert to private structs by default.
